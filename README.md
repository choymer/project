For resolving the task, I thought using Google Maps JS API, will provide the markers that I need for plot a each coordinates into the map. An advantage is that is easy to setup.

The API key is embedded on the HTML script, I have restricted it uses only for Maps, so I intentionally uploaded, instead of saving into a environment variable. 

One of the requirement is a mobile-first approach, I've used Bootstrap due to its cross browser compatibility, is highly customizable and is responsive.
